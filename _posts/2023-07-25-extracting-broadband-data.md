## 🥟 Appetizer  
We needed to extract broadband coverage data for counties surrounding the capitals of **Alabama and Georgia**, but the source website aggressively blocked IP addresses after detecting high traffic. This made large-scale data scraping nearly impossible through conventional means.

## 🍲 Main Dish  
To sidestep the IP throttling issue, we developed a novel scraping workflow that avoids hitting the same endpoints repeatedly:

- Rather than pulling bulk datasets directly, we **reverse-geocoded incrementally spaced latitude-longitude coordinates** and delayed sampling to retrieve addresses block-by-block.
- This allowed us to systematically gather coverage data at the **block group level** without tripping anti-bot protections.

    <pre class="mermaid">

    A[Select GEOIDs to parse] --> B{Data @ geography <br/> level exist?}
    B -- Yes, move to next --> A
    B -- No --> C[Generate n </br> points inside shape]
    C -- Lat, Lon --> D[Reverse </br> geocode]
    D -- Address --> E[Query </br> Broadband Website]
    E --> G{At least one </br> query success?}
    G -- No, n*=2 --> C
    G -- Yes --> H[Save to file]
    H --> I{More data to </br> extract?}
    I -- No --> J[Done]
    I -- Yes --> A
    </pre>
  </div>
</div>

- We tested multiple VPN approaches, and found that **IP rotation tools like Surfshark’s** were not reliable overnight—often stalling or failing to refresh, making them unsuitable for unattended scraping.
- A tailored approach for simulating human browsing behavior—combined with measured pacing—enabled us to collect data from the website in a respectful and non-intrusive manner.

## 🍵 Aftertaste  
The final workflow allowed us to successfully extract **100% block-group level coverage** for the targeted regions:

## 🍽️ Final Bite  
When brute force breaks down, precision wins. In scraping, as in design, knowing *where* to poke often matters more than how hard you push. Sometimes, the cleverest path is the one that mimics how humans would look things up—just with a lot more patience.
