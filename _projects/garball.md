The Gar-Ball is a hands-on introduction to garbology—the study of what we throw away and why it matters. Designed like a gumball machine, it turns the simple act of recycling into an engaging moment of surprise and delight. Made from PVC, nylon, and netting, the Gar-Ball invites curiosity, sparking conversations about waste, behavior, and the invisible systems that shape our habits. By making trash visible and interactive, it transforms garbology from an academic concept into a playful, personal experience.
