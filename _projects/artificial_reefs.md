This video showcases the outcomes of Yfalos, a Computational Design and Digital Fabrication workshop hosted by DigitalFutures.world. Conducted simultaneously across three time zones through a hybrid virtual design platform and physical fabrication labs, the workshop explored how digital architecture can respond to global crises. Yfalos emphasized circular design strategies and demonstrated the potential of global collaboration paired with localized production, highlighting the power of a connected, digitally enabled design community.
